This is the documentation about Kiwix-plug for the Raspberry Pi and is
complementary to the README. Kiwix-plug is a solution allowing
everyone to set up an open Wifi kiosk to deliver contents available in
the ZIM format. The solution is adapated for the Raspberry Pi, use the
Kiwix-serve technology and many open source softwares. This
documentation explains how to setup Kiwix-plug.

== Requirements ==
* A Raspberry Pi (http://www.raspberry.org)
* A Wi-Fi USB dongle or any Wi-Fi device, with a Linux driver compatible
  with hostapd: currently hostap, wired, madwifi, test, none, nl80211, bsd
* An SD card with at least 4GB to store the OS and the data.
* ZIM files you want to spread (http://openzim.org/ZIM_File_Archive)
* A wireline LAN allowing access to Internet with a free RJ45 port
* A master computer with a UNIX and a root access, GNU/Linux is perfect.
  This computer needs a SD card port to setup kiwix-serve in the Raspbian
  system, and possibly a free USB port to put the flash drive to
  setup. You need free space on this system: at least 3x the size
  of the ZIM files you want to copy on the storage device.
* Time: preparing the "master" (mainly downloading the ZIM files and
  computing the full-text search engine indexes) can take hours,
  depending of the size of the contents and the power of your computer.
  Do not wait the last minute!

== Overview ==

The installation comes in 3 steps:

0 Get the code to do all the stuff.

1 Run "setup_master.sh" to prepare everything on your computer. It
  especialy downloads the binaries to install on the plug, compute
  indexes, etc.

2 Run "setup_raspberrypi_sd.sh" to prepare a raw SD card with
  Raspbian.

3 Run "setup_raspberrypi.sh" to finalize Raspbian system
  configuration.

4 Run "setup_usbkey.sh" to copy all data necessary on your USB flash
  drive because data partition does not have to be on the SD card.

5 OPTIONAL: Add a router to the plug to increase the wireless
  coverage.

== Retrieving the code ==

See README

== Setup the master ==

See README

== Setup SD card with Raspbian ==

You can set up the Raspberry Pi either from the Raspberry Pi itself
either with SSH from a remote computer. In the first case, the
Raspberry Pi is called "master" and must be connected to the Internet.
In the second case, the remote computer is called the "master", must
be connected to the Internet, and the Raspberry Pi must be connected
to this computer through the local network.

== Setup the Raspberry Pi ==

We will now do a minimal configuration of the Raspberry Pi system
card. Connect your Raspberry Pi to the same local network as the
master computer.

Run "./setup_raspberrypi.sh", this should do a few things. This will
be fast, because this only install if necessary a few packages, add an
init.d script and initiate the clock.

WARNING: Make sure your Wi-Fi USB dongle or Wi-Fi connection has a
Linux driver, and this one is compatible with the Wi-Fi Access Point
software (hostapd). Currently it has only been tested with a D-Link
with the driver rtl8192cu, which requires a special compilation of hostapd.
If your Wi-Fi driver is not nl80211, you have to change this parameter in the
USB key configuration USBKEY/system/conf/hostapd.conf after the files are
copied on the USB key in the next step.

== Setup the flash storage with content ==

See README

== Conclusion ==

You should have now a perfectly working kiwix-plug. You should see now
a new Wifi network called "KIWIX_PLUG" appearing. Connect to it using
your laptop/smartophone/tablet, open a new Web browser windows and go
on any website. You should land to the Kiwix-plug Welcome page.
